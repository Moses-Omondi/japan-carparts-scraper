## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### Command Line
```bash
# Scrape 50 products from Polish Venture
python run_fast.py https://polishventure.com/shop/ 50

# Scrape 200 products from any site
python run_fast.py https://example.com/products 200
```

### Python Code
```python
import asyncio
from fast_excel_scraper import FastExcelScraper

async def main():
    config = {
        'max_concurrent_requests': 8,
        'request_delay': 0.3,
        'max_pages': 10
    }
    
    scraper = FastExcelScraper(config)
    products = await scraper.scrape_website_async('https://example.com')
    filename = scraper.save_to_excel(products)
    await scraper.close_session()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

```python
config = {
    'max_concurrent_requests': 8,     # Concurrent requests (1-20)
    'request_delay': 0.3,             # Delay between requests (0.1-2.0)
    'timeout': 20,                    # Request timeout in seconds
    'max_products_per_page': 50,      # Products to extract per page
    'max_pages': 20,                  # Maximum pages to scrape
    'retry_attempts': 2               # Retry failed requests
}
```

## 📊 **Excel Output**

The scraper generates Excel files with:
- **Products Sheet**: All scraped product data
- **Formatted Headers**: Bold, colored headers
- **Auto-sized Columns**: Optimized column widths
- **Timestamp**: Unique filenames with timestamps

### Excel Columns:
- ID, Product Name, Price (KES/USD/JPY/EUR)
- Original Currency, Raw Price Text
- SKU, Product URL, Source URL, Scraped Date

## 🗑️ **What Was Removed**

To optimize for speed and Excel-only export:

❌ **Removed Features:**
- PDF generation (reportlab dependency)
- Image processing and downloading (Pillow dependency) 
- Complex currency conversion
- Progress tracking files
- Detailed logging files
- Resume capability (for this fast version)

✅ **Kept Features:**
- Excel export with formatting
- Multi-currency price detection
- Product data extraction
- Error handling
- Async/concurrent processing

## 🎯 **Best For:**

- **Quick data extraction** for analysis
- **Large-scale scraping** with speed priority
- **Simple Excel reports** without complex formatting
- **Development and testing** with fast iterations

## 🔧 **Requirements**

```
requests>=2.28.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0  
lxml>=4.9.0
aiohttp>=3.8.0
pandas>=1.5.0
openpyxl>=3.1.0
python-dateutil>=2.8.0
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **Respectful Scraping**: Still includes delays and limits to avoid overwhelming servers
2. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failed requests and timeouts
3. **Site Compatibility**: Optimized for Polish Venture but works with most e-commerce sites
4. **JavaScript Sites**: Won't work with heavily JavaScript-dependent sites (same limitation as original)

## 🔄 **Switching Back**

To use the full-featured version:
```bash
git checkout main
```

The original features (PDF generation, image processing, etc.) are available on the main branch.
