## 🎯 Expected Results

- **Sub-50 second performance** for moderate catalogs
- **5-10x speed improvement** over standard settings  
- **Maintained data quality** with configurable trade-offs

## 🔧 Configuration

Speed vs Quality trade-offs:
- Set `extract_images: false` for maximum speed
- Set `extract_descriptions: false` to skip detailed text
- Increase `max_concurrent_requests` for faster processing
- Decrease delays for speed (but respect server limits)
