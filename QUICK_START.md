# üöó Japanese Car Parts Scraper

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**Most modern Japanese car parts websites use JavaScript** to load their product listings. This means our scraper (which reads static HTML) will often fall back to **sample data** to demonstrate functionality.

## How to Run

```bash
# Test with sample data (always works) - RECOMMENDED
./run.sh --sample-only

# Try scraping a website (may fall back to sample data)
./run.sh https://autoparts.beforward.jp/search/Lightings/Headlights/

# Test multiple sites to find one that works
./venv/bin/python test_sites.py
```

## What it does

1. **Attempts to scrape** Japanese car parts websites
2. **Falls back to sample data** if the site uses JavaScript (most do)
3. **Converts** JPY prices to USD using live exchange rates  
4. **Generates** professional PDF reports and CSV exports

## Why You Keep Seeing the Same Data

The Toyota Supra A90 Front Bumper and other parts you see are **sample data** because:
- Modern websites load content with JavaScript
- Our scraper only reads static HTML
- This is a common limitation of simple web scrapers

## Output Files

Check the `outputs/` directory:
- **PDF Report**: Professional format with part details
- **Compact PDF**: Table format for quick reference
- **CSV**: Raw data for spreadsheet analysis
